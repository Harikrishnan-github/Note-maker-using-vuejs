WEB APP USING VUE.JS

This application allows users to do following 

* Create a new note 

* Show list of all created notes

* Edit an existing note

* Delete an existing note

What I was able to achieve so far 

I am able to create a new note , push it into an array and also delete a note from the array . I am finding it a bit hard to edit an existing note . The closest I came was to completely delete the note and create new note . 

P.S : I have not focused on CSS as the importance was given to the functionality of application rather than style .  I will style the application once I get the app fully functional .
